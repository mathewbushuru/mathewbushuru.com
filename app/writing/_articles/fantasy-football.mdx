{/* Motivation for project  */}
My goal for this project is to pick the ultimate English Premier League Fantasy Football team using past player performance. Obviously past performance is not indicative of future performance but I think this project will be a fun exercise.

{/* What is fantasy football */}

{/* Fantasy Premier League (FPL) API  */}

{/* Get all basic stats for each player, Get gameweek specific data for each player, Get season history for each player */}

{/* Alternatively, get data from vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League */}
We will be using FPL data from vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League instead of scraping it ourselves.

{/* Add player data to a database (ArcticDB?) */}

{/* Merge player data into single dataframe with ket statistics  */}

{/* Analyze FPL player  data and run a Monte Carlo simulation to select optimal team based on predefined constraints  */}
