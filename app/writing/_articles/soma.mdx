A few weeks ago, I was talking to one of my friends about a social venture
that I have spent most of this year working on. He wanted to know what we do
and I told him that we provide online educational content like Wikipedia and
Khan Academy to students in high schools but offline. His next question is
what led me to write this medium post. The question was: “What is the point of
that? Nowadays, everyone is online 24/7 anyway.”

This might come as a surprise to some but according to the United Nations, 52%
of the world’s population currently has no access to the internet. That’s 4
billion people! Most of these people live in developing countries and
especially in rural areas. Here, internet access is often slow, unreliable or
not available at all. And even if it is available, many people simply cannot
afford. This is what prompted us to start Soma.

Soma makes online open educational resources accessible to everyone, offline.
We store these resources in our content servers that can be used in
low-resource communities such as rural schools, non-formal school systems and
even prison systems which would otherwise have no access to these resources.

There is a lot of great open educational content out there and it would
probably take centuries for our small team to include all of it in our
servers. For this reason, we have to prioritize. Currently, we look for
content that is of high quality, has an explicit open license e.g.
*Creative Commons CC-BY*, and what we think is useful and educational
for our users. At the moment, we have these services but we are working hard
to increase them:

We have tried our best to not only include material that prepares our users
for their school exams but to also include resources that enable them to gain
the skills that they have always wished to have. This explains why we have a
whole medical encyclopedia in our servers yet our target users are high school
students. Maybe, we still don’t have a cure for cancer because about 50% of
the possible inventors have been locked out of the information they might need
to get started. This is what drives us at Soma every day.

One thing that I love about Soma is our emphasis on emerging technologies
especially coding. This summer we have been running a ‘learn to code’ program
in four Kenyan high schools called *Tucode*. I have realized that when
most people think about programming, they think that you have to be
half-machine to do it. But I think coding is more about people than about
machines. I think coding shares more with expression, writing, music and art;
more than it does with math. This is why anyone can learn how to do it.

As humans, we really love stories. It’s easier to connect to a topic if you
are telling it in terms of a story or a narrative. It’s not just getting up
there and saying that this is the method to do this, this is the process, etc.
It is about trying to create a story out of the technologies. This is the
approach that we took with Tucode and we are incorporating into Soma’s
learning platform.

At Soma, we are proud of being an African company. Africa has the highest
percentage of people unconnected to the internet and this is why we chose to
start here. In my opinion, the point of technology is not to help ourselves
but to help others. We all want a diverse and vibrant African economy. The
more people access Soma’s servers, the more they unlock their potential. And
not only that, they inspire other people to realize what their life can be.
That they can learn, do and create anything. We believe that there are more
than a thousand ways to do anything and in each of those little differences
are our individualities, and we want to celebrate that. We might not teach you
all the one thousand ways, but Soma will give you a headstart.
