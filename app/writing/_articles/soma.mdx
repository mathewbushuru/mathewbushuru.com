summary: "An introduction to Soma Offline and inspiration behind the project"
preview: "A few weeks ago, I was talking to one of my friends about a social venture that I have spent most of this year working on. He wanted to know what we do and I told him that we provide online educational content like Wikipedia and Khan Academy to students in high schools but offline. His next question is what led me to write this medium post. The question was: 'What is the point of that? Nowadays, everyone is online 24/7 anyway.'"
