SQL Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of joins, each serving a different purpose. In this article, we'll explore them using  PostgreSQL examples.

## 1. INNER JOIN

An `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables. In the example below, only the rows from the `users` table that have an order in the `orders` table will be returned.

```sql 
SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.user_name,
    orders.order_id
FROM 
    users 
INNER JOIN 
    orders 
ON  
    users.user_id = orders.fk_user_id;
```

Inner  joins are most commonly used join operations

## 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

A `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, the result will contain `NULL` for columns for the right table. In the example below, the query returns all rows in the `users` table, including those without matching orders, where the `orders_id` column will be `NULL` for these users.

```sql 
SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.user_name,
    orders.order_id
FROM 
    users 
LEFT JOIN 
    orders 
ON  
    users.user_id = orders.fk_user_id;
```

## 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

As the name suggests, `RIGHT JOIN` is the opposite of `LEFT JOIN`. It returns all the rows from the right table,  and the matched rows from the left table. If no results are found, the columns of the left table will contain `NULL`. The query below will return all the orders in the `order` table, including those which have no corresponding user in the `users` table.

```sql 
SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.user_name,
    orders.order_id
FROM 
    users 
RIGHT JOIN 
    orders 
ON  
    users.user_id = orders.fk_user_id;
```

## 4. FULL OUTER JOIN 

A `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns rows where there is a match in either table. It returns rows from both tables and fills `NULL` for non-matching rows in both sides. The query below will return all users and all orders, with `NULL` values where there is no match.

```sql 
SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.user_name,
    orders.order_id
FROM 
    users 
FULL OUTER JOIN 
    orders 
ON  
    users.user_id = orders.fk_user_id;
```

## 5. CROSS JOIN 

A `CROSS JOIN` returns the cartesian product of two tables, meaning each row from the first is combined with every row from the second table. The query below returns all possible combinations of users and products, regardless of any matching condition.

```sql 
SELECT 
    users.user_name,
    products.product_name 
FROM 
    users 
CROSS JOIN 
    products;
```

You can get the same result as above using what is usually referred as `implicit cross joins`. This is where you do a select from multiple tables separated by a comma as shown below.

```sql 
SELECT * FROM users, products;
```

## 6. SELF JOIN

A `SELF JOIN` is when a table is joined with itself. This can be useful for hierarchical data or for comparisons within the same table. In the example below, we are joining the `employees` table to itself to show employees and their managers.

```sql 
SELECT 
    e1.name AS employee,
    e2.name AS manager
FROM 
    employees e1
JOIN 
    employees e2 
ON 
    e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

##  Points to Remember

As you might have noticed, I have qualified the column names with the table names in the examples above. This is a good practice as it prevents the query from failing if we introduce duplicate columns to the tables in the future.

Left and right outer joins are functionally equivalent. You can replace one with the other by simply switching the order of the tables around.
