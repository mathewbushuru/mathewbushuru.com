summary: "Exploring full-stack drag and drop applications and how to storee the drag information in a database"
preview: "In a typical drag and drop application, each draggable item stores information about its position in the list. When the item is dragged, this information changes. A challenge that arises when working with such systems is figuring out the best way to store this information in the database in an efficient way. In this article, we will explore the different ways to handle this starting from a completely clientside approach then introducing a server and database to persist the drag information. To view what we will be building by the end of this article, visit mathewbushuru.com/experiments/0001."
