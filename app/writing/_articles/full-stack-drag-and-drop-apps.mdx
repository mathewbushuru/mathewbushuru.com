summary: "Exploring full-stack drag and drop applications and how to store the drag information in a database"
preview: "In a typical drag and drop application, each draggable item stores information about its position in the list. When the item is dragged, this information changes. A challenge that arises when working with such systems is figuring out the best way to store this information in the database in an efficient way. In this article, we will explore the different ways to handle this starting from a completely clientside approach then introducing a server and database to persist the drag information."

In a typical drag and drop application, each draggable item stores
information about its position in the list. When the item is
dragged, this information changes. A challenge that arises when
working with such systems is figuring out the best way to store this
information in the database in an efficient way. In this article, we
will explore the different ways to handle this starting from a
