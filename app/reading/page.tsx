        In this space, I keep a collection of books I have read recently. Most of
        the stuff I read these days is technical, including revisiting text
        books from my college courses and exploring new programming books.
        However, I do dive into some fiction every now and then. So if you're
        curious about stuff that interests me, please take a look around!
