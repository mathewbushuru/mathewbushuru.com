        In this space, I keep a collection of books I have read recently. Since
        completing university, finding time to read has been a bit of a juggle,
        but I still manage to squeeze in some reading here and there. Most of
        the stuff I read these days is technical, including revisiting text
        books from my college courses and exploring new programming books.
        However, I do dive into some fiction every now and then. So if you're
        curious about stuff that interests me, please take a look around!
